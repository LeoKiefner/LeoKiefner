👋 Hello, I am @LeoKiefner

🎸 I like playing guitar, reading and swimming

📖 I am a dedicated second-year Computer Science student at IUT Robert Schuman, specializing in software solution development with a passion for web development. My education has equipped me with a solid command of programming languages such as C, C#, and Java, as well as web development skills with HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL databases. My versatility also extends to software engineering with an understanding of UML and effective use of version control systems like Git.

💻 My project portfolio includes contributing to the creation of a Windows Forms application to select recipes based on available ingredients, as well as a showcase website and a Sudoku solver, demonstrating my ability to translate user needs into functional solutions. I have developed a deep understanding of backend systems and processes with Python and database management systems, positioning me to aim for a Full Stack Web Developer role.

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 I am eager to apply my full-stack development skills to create interactive and responsive web experiences. My goal is to join a team where I can contribute to innovative projects and continue to grow as a web developer.
